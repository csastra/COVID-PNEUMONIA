# COVID-Pneumonia-Project
The current repository contains the code to clean, feature engineer, and model to predict the likelihood of obtaining pneumonia based on COVID symptoms.
The data has been pre-processed.
The data is to be feature engineered.
The data is to be modeled by the Strong Optimal Classification Tree.

## Dataset
Before running the code, request access and download the [data](https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/COVID-19-Case-Surveillance-Restricted-Access-Detai/mbd7-r32t!).
Once downloaded, manually extract each .zip file and store them in the root of the repository.
Note: The extracted files will be more than 200GB.
